If you are blocking upwards, you will parry any overhead swings coming against you, but you will not stop thrusts or attacks to your sides. Either of these attacks would still be able to hit you.

I bought a load of goods like I told you I would, loaded them up, and I would have taken them all the way to Slaver's Bay -- but wouldn't you know it, I was attacked by a band of corsairs, outside Volantis, and lost it all.

My mother's family, whom I hoped would give me a start in trading, have not been as welcoming as I have hoped. I receive nothing but lectures from my aunts, on how I have ruined my prospects for marriage by taking service in a mercenary company. Perhaps I am better suited to war than to commerce, to share a meal over a campfire with rough fellows than to drink wine with the merchants of Oldtown. {playername}, I must ask you -- will you take me back?"),

For my part, I've been having some difficulties coaxing a living from my estates -- locusts, bad rains, unruly serfs, oh, and a slave rebllion followed by a dragon attack that seared the greater part of my family.

I joined a caravan out of King's Landing, bound for Horn Hill, but it was overtaken by outlaws and after my ransom I was set free here. There may be better places in the world than this, but I have yet to see them. So I think, if it is my lot to live here, then your company is as good a livelihood as any. Will you have me back?"),

I could not find enough men to crew a longship, and those whom I gathered quickly got bored and wandered off -- not, I will add, before they drank away such gold as I had accumulated. So I thought back to the battles we fought together. Those were good days, and profitable ones too."),

Half of them ask me to collect debts from fellow lords, as though I were a banker's errand boy, or chase down his serfs, as though I were a farm overseer.

They rent the books out chapter to by chapter to apprentices to copy, but half of them aren't returned, and those that are have pages soaked in wine, and there's no longer a complete copy of my work anywhere.

Things are going easy for me lately. Too easy. The money is soundly invested, and I've got some men working on my farms. For me there's nothing left to do. What do you think, shall we revive old times?"),

Like a typical citadel-educated healer, he went right to Ellendor for a cure. Ellendor recommends mercury for dropsy. Now, most of Ellendor's writings were useless back in the days of the Targaryen kings, when they were first written down, and they're doubly worthless today, but sometimes he hits upon the right cure by chance: mercury does cure some kinds of dropsy in small doses. However, mercury in large doses is poison, something that the Ellendor-worshippers never grasped."),

Finest archers you ever saw, and good riders too, but they have no stomach for fighting in ranks.

You can't see them any more with all the rebuilding, but the slabs are the size of a house.

He was so captivated that he set out to slay the King of Cracklaw Point, who had been terrorizing the countryside, to gain her favor. When he finally completed his quest, Jonquils father gave him her hand in marriage, but a year later they where both dead!

Right now, the world's a mess -- the lord owns the land, except it's the prince who owns the forest, but the city has the right to levy tax at its gates, and the commons can use the pastures on odd days, except in Qohor when it's the fifth day.

If you became {king/queen}, then I'd ask you open your court to the common folks, and not just to the lords and ladies.

In fact, I think I can even recall a prophecy to that effect. Hmm, how did it go..."),

Everything must be done as it was done in the days of old -- even though not more than one in a hundred of them can read enough to understand the chronicles! Northern merchants marry their daughters according to the 'old' rite. Westerlands cattle herders churn 'royal' butter. And of course, every king must be crowned according to 'ancient' law."),

And given what I know of their secrets, they'd not want to be denying me admission to their halls, now would they?"),

Give me a few weeks and I'll go to some of these villages -- stinking hovels that they are, but I reckon I can take care of myself these days. I'll tell the people there that once you unify this land, you'll wipe it clean of banditry. You'll erect gallows along the roads and keep them well-stocked with broken-necked thieves, so that every passerby knows that the wages of indecency is death."),

There's no right way to crown a {king/king or queen}, and thus it makes sense that the crown should go to the one most fit to govern -- which would be you, naturally.

I'll sing them a pretty song about what you'll do as {king/queen}, about all the ancient freedoms you'll restore -- let them rob their tenants and tax the merchants and fight their wars and spend themselves silly without a thought to tomorrow, as a noble ought! What do you say to that, {playername}?"),

Occasionally, too, you catch sight of one of the great war horses that are the pride of the nobility. The land here is rich -- but also troubled, as the occasional burnt-out farm bears witness, a testament to the chaos the Tyrell host caused when it marched through sixteen years earlier. You keep a wide berth of the forests, where desperate men have taken refuge.

You knew that you were relatively safe at sea, as you were too far south to risk encountering the sea raiders who trouble the coasts of the Nordic lands, but it was still a relief to reach the Selver estuary, gateway to the port of Jelkala, and see a Rhodok galley riding at anchor, its pennants fluttering in the evening breeze."),

It was some relief when your ship came in sight of the delta of the Vyl and Boluk rivers, and a short while later, rowed past tidal flats and coastal marshes to the city of Sargoth, home to the Sea Raiders' distant kinsmen, the Nordic lords, who a few generations ago had carved themselves a kingdom in this rich but troubled land."),

On some hillsides the thin grass of spring was already turning yellow, but the lower slopes of the mountains were still a vibrant green. Herds of sheep and tawny steppe ponies drifted across them like clouds, testifying to the wealth of the Khergit khans.

The small bands of raiders who hovered just out of bowshot, waiting to pick off stragglers, were oddly a comfort -- at least water could be no more than a day's ride away.
